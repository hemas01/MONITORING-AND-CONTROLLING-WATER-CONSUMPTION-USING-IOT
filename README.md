# Water Monitoring and Control System

## Overview

The Water Monitoring and Control System is an Arduino-based project designed to tackle the issue of water wastage during everyday activities like cooking, washing, and showering. By integrating water flow sensors, an LCD display, a buzzer, and a GSM module, this system enables real-time monitoring and remote control of water usage, promoting efficient water conservation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Water Monitoring**: Measures and displays water consumption using flow sensors and an LCD screen.
- **User Alerts**: Provides notifications and reminders about water usage patterns and potential leaks through buzzers and the LCD display.
- **Remote Control**: Allows users to remotely shut off the water supply using a GSM module and solenoid valve.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easily expandable with additional sensors and components to fit different applications and scales.
